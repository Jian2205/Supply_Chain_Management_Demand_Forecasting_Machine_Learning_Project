# Supply_Chain_Management_Demand_Forecasting_Machine_Learning_Project
Author: Jianlumei Kamei
This is my one-month internship project at Unified Mentor. I built a machine learning model using a tuned Random Forest Regressor to forecast the number of products sold in a supply chain. The project includes feature engineering, evaluation metrics, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard for predictions.
